A fundamental algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more predictors.

Logistic Regression
A classification algorithm used for binary outcomes, ideal for problems involving categorical variables.

Decision Trees
A non-parametric supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks.

Random Forest
An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting.

Support Vector Machines (SVM)
A powerful classification technique that works well for both linear and non-linear data.

K-Means Clustering
An unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning data into distinct clusters based on feature similarity.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving variance.

Neural Networks
A foundational algorithm for deep learning, suitable for a wide range of tasks including image and speech recognition.
